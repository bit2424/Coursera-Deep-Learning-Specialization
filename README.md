# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization Repository

This repository contains my progress and assignments related to the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization course. The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location to store my work and to share it with others who may be interested in deep learning.

In times where advances are being done so regularly, going back to the fundamentals allows us to keep perspective on what actually are the systems we are bulding.
